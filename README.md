# Node Manager
Manage and track Houdini HDAs and Nuke Gizmos/Snippets

Design Points
- Should feel like the user is just referencing node definitions from a directory on disk. Minimise extra steps.
- All node changes tracked through source control.
- Use standard UIs and workflows where possible.

Requirements:
- `GitPython`: https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/
- `packaging`: https://pypi.org/project/packaging/
